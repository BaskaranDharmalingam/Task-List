## **32BIT PROCESSOR:**
 It is type of CPU architecture used to transfer the 32bit data.It is the amount of process can be processed by our CPU whenever its perform an operation
 1. It has 4GB Space.
 2. It need a Support of 32bit operating system.
 3. Its not working with stress testing and multitasking.
 4.  Its support the systems such as window 7,8,Linux,XP,vista.
 5.  It doesn't allow use of 4GB Physical memory space.
The only advantage that one can mention is that it is compatible with all the older devices which are developed in early 2000 and late 1990.
## **64BIT PROCESSOR:**
In computer architecture, 64 bit refers to the number of bits which should be processed or transmitted in parallel or the number of bits used for a single element in a data format. A 64-bit microprocessor allows computers to process data and memory address which are represented by 64 bits.
 1. It has 16GB Space.
 2. It support both 32bit and 64bit operating system.
 3. Its working with both stress testing and multitasking.
 4. Its support the systems such as window 7,8,10,Linux,Max OS X.
 5. It will enable you to use 17 Billion GB of RAM 
The advantage of 64bit processor is its allow virtual memory process and Provide security features.

The maximum memory  of 32 bit is 4GB and 64bit is 16GB.
