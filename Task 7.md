# ***Object oriented programming:*** 
Object oriented programming is a computer programming in a which programmers define the data type of a data structure and also the operations can be applied to the data structure.
It around only the data and object rather than the function and logic.
The object oriented concepts are,
 - Object
 - Class
 - Abstraction
 - Encapsulation
 - Inheritance
 - Polymorphism
 - Information hiding
 - Interface
 - Messaging

The object oriented programming is usefull for the programmers
because the programs are large,complex and easily updated.
## Object:
Object is defined a data field that has unique attribute and behaviour.
object is a entity and it consist of both data and procedure to manipulate the data.
**Example:**
 A dog has states - color, name, breed as well as behaviors – wagging the tail, barking, eating.
## Class:
Class is template definition and it contain methods and variables in particular kind of object.
Object is instance of class,it contain real value instead of class.
**Example:**
    class <class_name>{  
        field;  
        method;  
      }
## Abstraction:
The process of picking out a common features of object and procedure.
**Example:**
Your car is a great example of abstraction. You can start a car by turning the key or pressing the start button. You don’t need to know how the engine is getting started, what all components your car has. The car internal implementation and complex logic is completely hidden from the user.
## Encapsulation:
Encapsulation is a wrapping of data in a single unit.Its a method to bind together the data and manipulates the data.
## Inheritance:
Inheritance is a method to where a new class is derived from existing class.
Sub Class:The class that inherits properties from another class is called Sub class or Derived Class.  
Super Class:The class whose properties are inherited by sub class is called Base Class or Super class.
**Example:**

    class subClass extends superClass  
    {  
       //methods and fields  
    }

## Polymorphism:
The word polymorphism means having many forms.we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form.
**Example:**
In real time life the human have different characterstics.Like a man at the same time is a father, a husband, an employee. So the same person posses different behavior in different situations. This is called polymorphism.
## Information Hiding:
 The process of hiding details of an object or function. Information hiding is a powerful programming technique because it reduces complexity.
## Interface:
The languages and codes that the applications use to communicate with each other and with the hardware.
## Messaging:
It is a form of communication used in parllel programming and object programming.
## Example:

     class person //Define the class
        {
        char name[20];//Data type
        int id;//Data type
        public://access specifier
        void getdetails(){}
        };
        int main()
        {
        Person p1;// p1 is a object
        }
